# ðŸ“Š Revenue Prediction with Polynomial Regression  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project applies **polynomial regression** to predict daily revenue using feature selection based on correlation analysis. The objective is to analyze the impact of different polynomial degrees on model performance and optimize predictive accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Features  
âœ” Feature selection based on correlation  
âœ” Polynomial regression (1st to 5th degree)  
âœ” Train-test split for model evaluation  
âœ” MSE analysis to detect overfitting  
âœ” Correlation heatmap visualization  

## ðŸ”¬ Data  
The dataset (`assignment1dataset.csv`) contains various features related to business revenue. The target variable is **RevenuePerDay**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results  
- Higher polynomial degrees improve training accuracy but can lead to **overfitting**.  
- Feature selection enhances model interpretability and efficiency.  
- Correlation analysis helps identify the most impactful predictors.
